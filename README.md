# Watchfaces (for Android 13+ (WearOS 4))
WearOS watchfaces. Created by me in Samsung's Watch Face Studio.

Art credits in other file.

## Download and install
Grab the files in Release (apk)

[Pair the watch with your computer's adb](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/get-started/debugging#physical-watch). Install like any normal app:

` adb install [filename] `

Long press your homescreen, then scroll to the rightmost tab (plus sign). Scroll to the bottom and choose watchfaces to set.
